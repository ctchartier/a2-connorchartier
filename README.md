## Calculator: Addition, Subtraction, Mulitplication, Division
    -My project allows the user to input two seperate numbers, one into each of the input boxes. Then the user is able to select a operation to perform on the two numbers with the reult showing up centered on the screen. There is also a seprate protion on the bottom of the screen the keeps track of the previous results for past operations. This array is then added onto each time the user performs an operation. I used CSS, classes, elements, and IDs to format different sections of my webpage.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Single Page App
    -I have created a single page app that allows the user to input two numbers and select a computation to complete. This then allows them to add, subract, multiply, and divide. The server side data is also displayed to the user at all times in the "Previous Results section".

- **Tech Achievement 2**: Modifing existing data
    -I did not add the ability to modify the existing data.
