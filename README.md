## Calculator: Addition, Subtraction, Mulitplication, Division
    - My project allows the user to input two seperate numbers, one into each of the input boxes. Then the user is able to select a operation to perform on the two numbers with the result showing up centered on the screen. There is also a seprate protion on the bottom of the screen the keeps track of the previous results for past operations. This array is then added onto each time the user performs an operation. The user can also delete a previous result. I used CSS classes, elements, and IDs to format different sections of my webpage.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Single Page App
    - I have created a single page app that allows the user to input two numbers and select a computation to complete. This then allows them to add, subract, multiply, and divide. The server side data is also displayed to the user at all times in the "Previous Results section".

- **Tech Achievement 2**: Modifing existing data
    - I do have the ablility to add and delete data on the server, though, I did not add the ability to edit the existing data stored in the previous results section.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Testing Participant #1
1. Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.
    - Silvester
2. What problems did the user have with your design?
    - They told me to truncate my decimals.
    - They told me to consider removing the word result next to each of my results since there is a header there
3. What comments did they make that surprised you?
    - They said that my stylistic choice to not have a line in between the two "Previous Results" table headers looked strange.
4. What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
    - I will be implementing a system to cap the number of decimal places that are in the results
    - I will be removing the word result next to each result.
    - I am not planning on adding a line in the table header between the two headers
- **Design Achievement 1**: Testing Participant #2
1. Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.
    - Greene
2. What problems did the user have with your design?
    - They also said the same thing about truncating decimals, they also suggested that the previous Results include a delete functionality
    - The number input allows the ability to input "e" which results in null outputs.
3. What comments did they make that surprised you?
    - They said that they perfered to see the buttons include the symbols of the operations instead of the words.
4. What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
    - I will be trucncating the decimals for the future
    - I will also be attempting to create a deleting function to remove entries from teh previous results section of the webpage.
    - I plan on trying to fix the "e" entry which gives a null return.
    - I do not plan on including the operation symbols instead of the words
